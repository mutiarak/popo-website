      <h1>Theory</h1>
      <p>
        Our POPO project is supported by four areas of knowledge:
        Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science.
        Each perspective explains a different part of how and why
        POPO works as a bioplastic.

      <h2>🧬 Biology — Why banana peels work</h2>
      <p>
        Biology explains why banana peels can become bioplastic.
        Banana peels contain starch and cellulose, which are natural
        polymers found in plants. These substances help bind materials
        together and give structure to plant cells.
      </p>
      <p>
        When used in POPO, starch and cellulose act like natural glue,
        allowing the mixture to hold its shape. Because banana peels
        come from living organisms, POPO can biodegrade, meaning
        microorganisms can break it down naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why POPO is safer for the environment than
        petroleum-based plastic.

    <!-- CHEMISTRY -->
    <div class="card section">
      <h2>⚗️ Chemistry — Why mixing changes the material</h2>
      <p>
        Chemistry explains how banana peels change into
        plastic-like material. When ingredients such as glycerin,
        vinegar, gelatin, and water are added, chemical interactions
        occur between the molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glycerin works as a plasticizer, which makes POPO flexible
        instead of brittle. Vinegar helps control acidity, improving
        stability, while gelatin strengthens the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        These chemical processes rearrange the material at a molecular
        level, turning soft banana pulp into a durable bioplastic.

    <!-- PHYSICS -->
    <div class="card section">
      <h2>⚙️ Physics — Why heat is necessary</h2>
      <p>
        Physics explains why heat and energy are needed to form POPO.
        Heating the mixture causes water to evaporate, which helps
        the bioplastic harden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heat energy also allows the material to spread evenly when
        cast into a mold, preventing weak spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        As POPO cools and dries, physical forces help it keep its
        shape and strength. Without proper heat and drying, POPO
        would remain soft and unusable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physics ensures the bioplastic becomes strong, flat,
        and consistent.

    <!-- COMPUTER SCIENCE -->
    <div class="card section">
      <h2>💻 Computer Science — Why technology is important</h2>
      <p>
        Computer science explains how data and information support
        the POPO project. Computers are used to research plastic
        pollution, analyze environmental data, and compare POPO
        with regular plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital tools help organize experiments, record results,
        and design posters or websites to communicate findings
        clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without computer science, it would be difficult to share
        the project effectively or show its environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology allows POPO to be understood, improved,
        and shared globally.
